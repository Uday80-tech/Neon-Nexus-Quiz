/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Brain Battle quiz game.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and quiz history,
 * and restricts write access to the leaderboard and questions collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizHistory/{quizHistoryId}: Stores quiz history, accessible only by the user.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores quiz questions, publicly readable, write access restricted.
 * - /leaderboard/{leaderboardEntryId}: Stores leaderboard entries, publicly readable, write access restricted.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile and quiz history data.
 * - Leaderboard data is publicly readable, but write access is restricted to prevent tampering.
 * - Questions are publicly readable, but write access is restricted to maintain data integrity.
 * - User listing is implicitly denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   None. Authorization is based on path-based ownership and pre-existing conditions, which does not require denormalization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *   Drafts and published content is not required for the application. Therefore, structural segregation is not required.
